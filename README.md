Emlia
=====

Emlia is a tabletop wargame system, similar in nature to Warhammer , DBA or Warmachine . Unlike these systems, however, Emlia is suitable for many different scales, genres, and settings. It is flexible, free, and in constant development. The philosophy of Emlia is made up of three simple things: flexibility – for any scenario, in any setting, in any scale – community – people building a game together – freedom – to produce, distribute, and sell content using an open source philosophy.
