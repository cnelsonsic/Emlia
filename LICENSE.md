Rules Content
-------------
Rules Content is defined as any content not describing specifics of a game setting. This includes dice mechanics, new skills or uses for skills, or abilities that apply to any setting other than the one in question. For example, rules for magic spells can apply to any setting with magic use, and are therefore rules content. The effects of individual spells are rules content. The descriptions of spells in a specific setting, however, are setting content and can be omitted. All rules content is subject to the above license on Emlia System documents. When any doubt exists as to the nature of content, it automatically defaults to rules content and is subject to the above license.

Setting Content
---------------
Setting Content is defined as the background information, art, unit sets, miniature lines, and scenarios that define a coherent setting for a game. Setting Content is NOT covered by the Emlia License - it may be distributed freely or commercially as the developers see fit. When distributing Setting Content, including commercial distribution, any Rules Content may be distributed with it in order to create a coherent rulebook. This rules content must still be made available under the above license.

Third Party Copyrights
----------------------
Some setting content may be copyrighted by a third party other than the Emlia Wiki owners and the developers of the rules associated with that setting. The Emlia Wiki team does not take responsibility for such posts, and all such content must be posted with the approval of the copyright holder OR under appropriate fair use laws. We will not remove such content at the request of copyright holders, though we will inform the original poster of the content if we are contacted by a copyright holder about improper use, and they may sort it out as the laws of their countries dictate.
